<!-- # About Me -->

I‚Äôm **Seyed Ali Ghazi Asgar**, a forth year Ph.D. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at **Texas A&M University**.  

I work across different fields like embedded systems, machine learning, and cybersecurity, with projects ranging from IoT and CPS security to wearable devices, biomedical signal processing, and hardware design.
  
**What makes me different?** I can do many different things!  I‚Äôve been designing PCBs, circuits, and programming microcontrollers since high school. Over the years I‚Äôve added skills in 3D printing, control systems, signal processing, and machine learning. I can move between hardware, software, and data-driven models, and I love bringing them together into real, working technologies.  

I enjoy solving complex problems, looking at them from different angles, and connecting ideas across disciplines. I‚Äôm always ready to take on new challenges and build creative solutions that make an impact.  

Because of this wide range of experience, I‚Äôm confident in roles that require embedded system design, firmware development, IoT and CPS security, biomedical device innovation, and machine learning applications. I don‚Äôt just specialize in one area‚ÄîI bring together skills in hardware, software, and ML to deliver complete, practical solutions. This makes me well-suited for R&D teams, startups, or industry positions where adaptability and interdisciplinary thinking are key.

  <div style="flex: 1; padding-right: 20px;">
    <strong>Rescuer Robot</strong><br>
    I participated in the IranOpen RoboCup Junior Rescue competition, where I worked as part of a
    team to design, build, and program an autonomous robot capable of navigating obstacle courses and
    simulating rescue operations. Our robot was equipped with sensors to detect lines, avoid obstacles,
    and identify hazardous areas, requiring real-time decision-making and precise movement control.
    Throughout the competition, I gained valuable hands-on experience in robotics engineering, coding,
    and sensor integration. Working under strict time constraints and in a highly competitive environment
    helped me develop strong teamwork, problem-solving, and project management skills.

    <strong>Small Size Soccer League</strong><br>
    I worked for one year in the Parsian Small Size Robot League, contributing to several projects focused
    on robotic system development. In one of my key projects, I designed and built a BLDC MOSFET
    driver tester. This device emulated hall sensor signals to the main controller and monitored the
    corresponding MOSFET outputs to verify correct operation. The tester helped diagnose faults in the
    motor driver by ensuring each MOSFET responded accurately to simulated input conditions.

  <div style="flex: 1; padding-right: 20px;">
    <strong>Customized XMEGA Evaluation Board</strong><br>
    I designed and built a customized development board based on an XMEGA microcontroller. The
    board includes multiple user-friendly interfaces for rapid prototyping and testing: multi-turn potentiometers for ADC input, LEDs and push buttons connected to GPIOs, and pin headers for PWM
    signal output. It features an LM2576 5V switching regulator and an AMS1117 3.3V linear regulator
    to provide stable voltage supplies. For communication, a USB-to-Serial converter IC is integrated
    under the pin headers, enabling easy interfacing with the XMEGA‚Äôs USART. Additionally, the board
    includes a dedicated pin header for connecting an I¬≤C LCD module.

  <div style="flex: 1; padding-right: 20px;">
    <strong>PID Motor Controller</strong><br>
    I used an optical encoder and the interrupt features of the XMEGA microcontroller to control the
    speed of a DC motor. The system captures encoder pulses with interrupts, making it possible to
    adjust the speed in real-time based on the feedback. A single MOSFET handles the motor driving.

  <div style="flex: 1; padding-right: 20px;">
    <strong>Small Robot Circuit</strong><br>
    I designed a control board circuit featuring multiple key components for efficient motor and sensor
    management. The board is equipped with IR receivers placed around it, which are connected to a
    multiplexer for reading multiple IR sensors through a single microcontroller pin. This setup enables
    precise position detection and obstacle sensing. A motor driver, although initially problematic, is
    included for controlling motor speed and direction. To power the board, a 5V switching regulator
    (LM2576) is used for high efficiency, while an AMS1117 linear regulator provides 3.3V for powering
    components like the NRF24L01+ wireless module.
